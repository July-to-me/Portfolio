# Julio's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here is where I leave links to all of my projects. I wanted to do this in order to have a one-stop shop to showcase the projects that I've done. I also want my GitHub to be more organized.

# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | 
|[Pokemon](https://github.com/July-to-me/Pokemon_Data_Analysis)| EDA & Regression Analysis | I wanted to see if there was a consistent trend in Pokemon types. I wanted to see if a type has a certain affinity to it, an example of this is whether fighting-type Pokemon have high attacks compared to other types. I conducted this analysis by grouping them into their respective types, as well as the generation the Pokemon was showcased, in order to see if there is a trend of Pokemon type being specialized in a certain affinity. |

# R

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | 
| [Bellabeat Fitness Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/July-to-me/Google-Data-Analytics-Project-FitBit-Data-)| EDA & Regression Analysis| This project was to help track users' health and sleeping habits. The dataset contained excellent daily, and hourly data in order to conduct various exploratory data analyses such as finding which days are people most active, and how long each person sleeps. So we can conduct questions such as which variables can we use to do a regression analysis in order to predict the amount of sleep or calories a person goes through a day.|
|[Yu-Gi-Oh! Text Analysis](https://github.com/July-to-me/Yu-Gi-Oh-Text-Analysis)| EDA & Natural Language Processing |This is a project that I am looking forward to working on. This is because I have ALOT of questions in relation to the state of Yu-Gi-Oh! One of the questions is whether or not card texts are getting longer for the game, how the wording is changing during a period of time, and so much more. I am planning to do my analysis in R as I am most comfortable at the moment, and would like to visualize my findings in Tableau in the future or in SAS. |
